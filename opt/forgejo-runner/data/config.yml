cache:
  #
  # When enabled, workflows will be given the ACTIONS_CACHE_URL environment variable
  # used by the https://code.forgejo.org/actions/cache action. The server at this
  # URL must implement a compliant REST API and it must also be reachable from
  # the container or host running the workflows.
  #
  # See also https://forgejo.org/docs/next/user/actions/advanced-features/#cache
  #
  # When it is not enabled, none of the following options apply.
  #
  # It works as follows:
  #
  # - the workflow is given a one time use ACTIONS_CACHE_URL
  # - a cache proxy listens to ACTIONS_CACHE_URL
  # - the cache proxy securely communicates with the cache server using
  #   a shared secret
